    <h2 id="discription">Course Discription</h2>
    <p>This class is designed for 12 + years old kids.
      Students will learn the syntax of the Java programming language,
       which can be used for programming most types of applications.
       And for many years the Java programming language has been one of the world‚Äôs most popular computer languages.
       My goal is to help students learn to program in the most popular language in the world: Java.
       We start from an introduction to Java using <a href="https://www.greenfoot.org/door">greenfoot</a>
       to learn OOP concepts like <i>class, object, inheritance, parent-child relationship of the class</i>
       then the second part of the class, we will learn how to write programs that have Graphic User Interface by writing
       the <i>Tic-Tac-Toe and Ping-Pong games.</i> then we will revisit java sytax in a more specific way like
        <i>variable, reference, eight fundamental data types, decisions controls flew, loops.</i> we also intruduce
        three to five data structures like <i>arrays , ArrayList, LinkedList, sets and maps.</i> we will also
       learn an important algorithm in problem solving :<i>Recursion</i> At last we we move to different
      area which is interacted website design using HTML, CSS,JAVAScript </p>
       <h2 id="goal">Class Goal</h2>
       <p>
         <ol>
           <li>üö©Understand fundamentals of programming such as variables, conditional and iterative execution, methods, etc.</li>
           <li>üö©Understand fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java, including defining
           classes, invoking methods, using class libraries, etc.</li>
           <li>üö©Be aware of the important topics and principles of software development.</li>
           <li>üö©Have the ability to write a computer program to solve specified problems.</li>
           <li>üö©Be able to use the Java SDK environment to create, debug and run simple Java programs</li>
         </ol>
</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisites</h2>
 <p>There is no prerequissites for this class as long as you are older than 12 years old and
    have an interest in learning programming</p>
<h2 id="teaching-method">Teaching Method</h2>
<p>I will use code-driven method throughout the course. I will code along with the students side by side every step the
  way. Students will engage themself in writing codes to build games and apps in a fun
  interacted way. They will use all the concepts they learned to build games which they enjoy playing.</p>
